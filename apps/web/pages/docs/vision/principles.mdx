# Core Principles

**The design philosophy behind every Cognia decision.**

---

These principles guide how we build Cognia. When facing trade-offs, we use these to decide.

---

## 1. Retention Over Completion

> **We optimize for what you remember, not what you've seen.**

It's easy to measure completion. It feels good to finish a course. But completion without retention is theater.

**This means:**
- Success = recall ability, not checkmarks
- Progress metrics reflect actual mastery, not exposure
- The system will make you revisit things (that's the point)
- "Finishing" a course means *retaining* it, which takes time

**Trade-off accepted:** Users can't rush through. The system enforces the pace that learning science demands.

---

## 2. Active Engagement Required

> **You can't passively consume your way to understanding.**

Reading and watching feel productive but don't create durable memory. Real learning requires effort: retrieval, application, struggle.

**This means:**
- Every concept requires active recall (quizzes)
- AI explanations lead to verification questions
- No "mark as complete" button—you prove understanding
- Struggle is expected and valuable

**Trade-off accepted:** Cognia is more demanding than video courses. That's why it works.

---

## 3. Granular Tracking

> **We track at the smallest useful level: the Information Point.**

Coarse tracking ("you're 60% through Chapter 3") hides crucial detail. Which specific concepts are weak? Where are the gaps?

**This means:**
- Every atomic concept has its own mastery score
- Quiz questions map to specific IPs
- Review targets exactly what's fading
- No redundant review of already-solid concepts

**Trade-off accepted:** More complexity under the hood. But users see clarity: "You need to review these 5 concepts."

---

## 4. AI as Infrastructure

> **AI isn't a feature—it's the foundation.**

Cognia couldn't exist without AI. It's not a traditional app with "AI features bolted on." The architecture assumes AI throughout.

**This means:**
- Courses are generated, not pre-written
- Tutoring is conversational and contextual
- Grading handles free-form responses
- Content adapts to individual learners

**Trade-off accepted:** Dependence on AI models. Quality tied to model capabilities. Cost per user higher than static content.

---

## 5. Prescribed, Not Chosen

> **The system decides what you study. You decide whether to show up.**

Decision fatigue kills learning habits. "What should I study?" leads to procrastination. Cognia removes that question.

**This means:**
- Daily queue is algorithmically generated
- Spaced repetition determines timing
- Question difficulty is selected, not chosen
- Users focus on *engaging*, not *planning*

**Trade-off accepted:** Less user control. Some will find this frustrating. But for most, removing decisions increases consistency.

---

## 6. Pedagogical Sequencing

> **Knowledge has structure. We respect it.**

Concepts build on other concepts. You can't understand recursion without understanding functions. You can't understand functions without understanding variables.

**This means:**
- Courses are sequenced for logical progression
- Prerequisites are enforced (but can be skipped by proving competency)
- IPs declare dependencies explicitly
- You can't skip ahead without demonstrating knowledge

**Trade-off accepted:** Less freedom to jump around. But prevents the confusion of encountering concepts without foundation.

---

## 7. Honest Progress

> **We show you where you actually are, not where you want to be.**

Many learning apps inflate progress to feel good. "You're doing great!" when you're actually struggling. This optimizes for short-term engagement at the cost of actual learning.

**This means:**
- Mastery scores reflect reality (including declines)
- Wrong answers are learning opportunities, not failures
- The system admits when you're forgetting
- Progress predictions are realistic, not optimistic

**Trade-off accepted:** Can feel demotivating when mastery drops. But honest feedback enables real improvement.

---

## 8. Multiple Entry Points

> **Different contexts need different interactions.**

Sometimes you want to study what's scheduled. Sometimes you want to explore. Sometimes you need to understand a mistake. One mode doesn't fit all needs.

**This means:**
- **Learn Mode**: Structured introduction to new concepts
- **Quiz Mode**: Active recall and testing
- **Reflection Mode**: Deep understanding after mistakes
- **Curiosity Mode**: Free exploration and discovery

**Trade-off accepted:** More complex product. But each mode serves a distinct, valuable purpose.

---

## 9. Just Enough Structure

> **Enough structure to guide, not so much it constrains.**

Too little structure: users flounder, don't know what to do, quit.
Too much structure: feels rigid, doesn't accommodate individual needs.

**This means:**
- Clear course hierarchy (Course → Module → Lesson → IP)
- Flexible within that structure (skip-ahead quizzes, curiosity exploration)
- Daily queue as suggestion, not requirement
- Multiple ways to engage with content

**Trade-off accepted:** Harder to implement. Have to balance guidance with flexibility case by case.

---

## 10. Start Simple, Prove Value

> **Better to do one thing well than many things poorly.**

It's tempting to build everything: social features, gamification, achievements, streaks, leaderboards. But each addition dilutes focus.

**This means:**
- Core loop first: learn, quiz, retain
- Additional features only when core is solid
- Saying no to good ideas that don't serve retention
- Measuring success by learning outcomes, not engagement metrics

**Trade-off accepted:** Slower feature velocity. Potentially less "sticky" than gamified alternatives. But sustainable learning over viral growth.
