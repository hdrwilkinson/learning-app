# Specifications

**Detailed technical specifications for implementation.**

---

This section contains the implementation-level documentation. These specs describe **exactly how** systems work—data models, algorithms, edge cases, and technical decisions.

> **Prerequisites:** Before reading specifications, you should understand the concepts in [Core Concepts](/docs/concepts) and the high-level mechanics in [How It Works](/docs/how-it-works).

## Organization

Specifications are grouped by domain:

### Content Structure
How courses and content are organized.

| Spec | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Course Structure & Navigation](/docs/specifications/course-structure-navigation) | Course hierarchy, path navigation, lesson states |
| [Course Creation](/docs/specifications/course-creation) | AI generation pipeline, validation loops, IP budgets |
| [Information Point Generation](/docs/specifications/information-point-generation) | IP content structure, prerequisite handling |

### Learning Mechanics
How users interact with content.

| Spec | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Learning & Interaction Modes](/docs/specifications/learning-interaction-modes) | Learn, Quiz, Curiosity, Reflection mode details |
| [Spaced Repetition Algorithm](/docs/specifications/spaced-repetition-algorithm) | Mastery tracking, scheduling, queue building |
| [Question Generation](/docs/specifications/question-generation) | Quiz types, generation process, grading |

### Analytics & Prediction
How progress is tracked and predicted.

| Spec | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Progress Prediction](/docs/specifications/progress-prediction) | Completion estimates, visualizations |
| [Data Collection & Analytics](/docs/specifications/data-collection-analytics) | What data is collected and how it's used |

## Document Format

Each specification includes:

### Metadata
```markdown
<!--
Status: Draft | Review | Approved | Implemented
Created: YYYY-MM-DD
Issue: #XX (if applicable)
Owner: Name
-->
```

### Related Specifications
Links to other specs that connect to this one.

### Data Models
TypeScript interfaces for the domain objects.

### Algorithm Details
Step-by-step logic for processes.

### Future Considerations
Things deferred or planned for later.

## Document Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | Being written, not ready for review |
| **Review** | Ready for feedback |
| **Approved** | Signed off, ready for implementation |
| **Implemented** | Feature is in code |
| **Deprecated** | No longer relevant |

## Reading Order

If you're reading specifications for the first time, this order builds understanding progressively:

1. **[Course Structure & Navigation](/docs/specifications/course-structure-navigation)** — Understand the content hierarchy
2. **[Spaced Repetition Algorithm](/docs/specifications/spaced-repetition-algorithm)** — Understand mastery and scheduling
3. **[Learning & Interaction Modes](/docs/specifications/learning-interaction-modes)** — Understand user interactions
4. **[Course Creation](/docs/specifications/course-creation)** — Understand how courses are generated
5. **[Question Generation](/docs/specifications/question-generation)** — Understand quiz mechanics
6. Remaining specs as needed
