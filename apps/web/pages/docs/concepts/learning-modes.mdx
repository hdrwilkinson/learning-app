# The Four Learning Modes

**How you interact with content in Cognia.**

---

## Overview

Cognia has four distinct interaction modes, each serving a specific learning purpose:

| Mode | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Learn** | Introduction to new concepts | Meeting an IP for the first time |
| **Quiz** | Active recall testing | Daily review, reinforcement |
| **Reflection** | Understanding mistakes | After wrong answers |
| **Curiosity** | Free exploration | Following your interests |

All modes share a **common chat interface**—they feel similar but have different goals and constraints.

---

## The Science Behind Each Mode

Each mode is designed around specific [learning science principles](/docs/concepts/learning-science):

| Mode | Primary Principles | How They're Applied |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Learn** | **Elaboration** | Connecting new concepts to prior knowledge, explaining in your own words |
| **Quiz** | **Retrieval Practice**, **Spaced Repetition** | Active recall (not re-reading), optimally timed review |
| **Reflection** | **Elaboration** | Deep processing of mistakes, understanding *why* you were wrong |
| **Curiosity** | **Elaboration** | Asking questions, exploring connections, generating explanations |

**Interleaving** appears across modes—your daily queue mixes items from different lessons, and question types vary within Quiz Mode.

---

## Mode 1: Learn Mode

**Purpose:** Introduce new Information Points with AI-guided explanation.

> **Primary Principle: Elaboration**
> 
> Learn Mode creates rich memory traces by connecting new information to what you already know, encouraging you to ask "why?" and explain concepts in your own words.

### What Happens

1. AI presents an IP's content (explanation, examples)
2. You can ask questions, request examples, or say "I got it"
3. Periodically, AI asks verification questions to confirm understanding ← *Retrieval Practice*
4. Once verified, you move to the next IP

│         The label (name, age) lets you retrieve the value later.│
│                                                                  │

│         And now `age` contains 31 instead of 30.                 │
│                                                                  │

### Entry Points
- Click an "Available" lesson on the course path
- Click "Continue Learning" on an in-progress lesson
- Dashboard: "Continue Learning" button

### What It Does to Your Data
- Marks IPs as `introduced` (now quiz-eligible)
- Sets initial mastery to ~20%
- Schedules first review ← *Spaced Repetition begins*

### Key Behaviors
- AI is patient and encouraging
- Stays focused on the current IP
- Won't move on until you demonstrate understanding
- References prerequisites when relevant ← *Elaboration: connecting knowledge*

---

## Mode 2: Quiz Mode

**Purpose:** Test recall through varied question types.

> **Primary Principles: Retrieval Practice + Spaced Repetition**
> 
> Quiz Mode is the core learning mechanic. You're not re-reading—you're actively retrieving information from memory, which strengthens learning far more than passive review. Questions appear at optimally spaced intervals.

### What Happens

1. System selects IPs that are due for review ← *Spaced Repetition: optimal timing*
2. Questions are presented one at a time
3. You answer; system evaluates ← *Retrieval Practice: active recall*
4. Correct → mastery increases, stability grows
5. Wrong → mastery decreases, option to reflect

### Question Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Binary (T/F)** | True or false statement | "Variables in Python are statically typed. T/F?" |
| **Multiple Choice** | 4 options, 1 correct | "What does `len()` return for a string?" |
| **Question & Answer** | Free-form response | "Explain the difference between `=` and `==`." |

Question type is selected based on your current mastery:
- Low mastery → easier types (binary, multiple choice)
- High mastery → harder types (Q&A, comparisons) ← *Desirable Difficulty*

### Entry Points
- Click a "Learning" or "Mastered" lesson
- Dashboard: "Daily Review" or "Study Now"
- End of a Learn Mode session

### What It Does to Your Data
- Updates mastery (up for correct, down for wrong)
- Adjusts stability (how long until next review) ← *Spaced Repetition*
- Schedules next review date
- Unlocks harder quiz types as mastery grows

### Timed vs. Untimed
- **Timed:** Questions have time limits; reflection can be queued for later
- **Untimed:** Take your time; reflect immediately on wrong answers

---

## Mode 3: Reflection Mode

**Purpose:** Help you understand concepts you got wrong.

> **Primary Principle: Elaboration**
> 
> When you get something wrong, shallow correction ("the answer was B") doesn't help. Reflection Mode uses deep processing—understanding *why* you were wrong, connecting your misconception to the correct concept, and generating new understanding.

### What Happens

1. Triggered after a wrong answer (or before answering if you choose)
2. AI explains the concept from a different angle ← *Elaboration: multiple perspectives*
3. Identifies where understanding broke down ← *Elaboration: connecting gaps*
4. Verifies correction before returning to quiz ← *Retrieval Practice*

### Entry Points
- Automatic: After wrong answer in Quiz Mode
- Manual: "Reflect First?" before answering
- Queued: At end of timed quiz (for all wrong answers)

### What It Does to Your Data
- Doesn't directly change mastery (that happened when you got it wrong)
- But reflection engagement is tracked for analytics
- May affect how the next question is selected

### Key Behaviors
- Stays focused on the specific IP you struggled with
- Won't let you wander to other topics (unlike Curiosity Mode)
- If you want to explore elsewhere: "Exit Quiz" → Curiosity Mode

---

## Mode 4: Curiosity Mode

**Purpose:** Free exploration and discovery.

> **Primary Principle: Elaboration**
> 
> Curiosity Mode is elaboration without constraints. You ask questions, explore connections, and generate understanding by following your interests. This creates rich, interconnected knowledge that transfers to new situations.

### What Happens

1. You can ask anything
2. AI responds with rich information
3. Optionally connects to course content ← *Elaboration: building connections*
4. Discoveries can be saved as new course content

Curiosity Mode comes in two flavors:

### In-Course Curiosity
You're exploring within the context of a course. The AI knows what you've learned and can make connections.

### General Curiosity
No course context. You're exploring freely. Discoveries can become new courses.

### Entry Points
- Dashboard: "Explore" or "Ask Anything"
- Within a course: "Curiosity" tab
- From Reflection Mode: "Exit Quiz" → "Explore freely"

### What It Does to Your Data
- Conversations are saved for reference
- Can trigger course creation (from interesting discoveries)
- Can add IPs to existing courses

### Key Behaviors
- No constraints on topics
- Encourages tangents and exploration
- Offers to save/structure valuable discoveries

## Summary

| Mode | Feel | Purpose | Primary Principles |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Learn** | Patient tutor | Introduction | Elaboration |
| **Quiz** | Testing booth | Recall practice | Retrieval Practice, Spaced Repetition |
| **Reflection** | Study buddy | Understand mistakes | Elaboration |
| **Curiosity** | Knowledgeable friend | Explore freely | Elaboration |

All modes use the same chat interface—the difference is context, purpose, and which learning science principles are emphasized.
