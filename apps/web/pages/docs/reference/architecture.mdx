# Architecture Decisions

**Significant technical choices and their rationale.**

---

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture important decisions about the system architecture. Each record explains:
- **Context**: What situation led to this decision
- **Decision**: What we chose
- **Consequences**: What trade-offs we accepted

---

## Decisions

*ADRs will be added as significant architectural decisions are made.*

---

## ADR Format

When adding a new ADR:

```markdown
## ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

**Context:**
What is the situation that requires a decision?

**Decision:**
What did we decide to do?

**Consequences:**
What are the positive and negative outcomes?

**Alternatives Considered:**
What other options were evaluated?
```
