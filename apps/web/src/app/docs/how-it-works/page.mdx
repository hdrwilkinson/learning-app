# How It Works

**The mechanisms that power Cognia.**

Now that you understand the [core concepts](/docs/concepts), this section explains *how* the system actually functions. Think of this as the "behind the scenes" tour—detailed enough to understand the system, but not at implementation level (that's in [Specifications](/docs/specifications)).

## Quick Overview

### Course Creation
1. You provide: topic, goals, available time
2. System assesses: your current level (baseline quiz)
3. AI generates: complete course structure sized for your schedule
4. Result: personalized pathway from where you are to where you want to be

### Daily Learning
1. Open app → see your daily queue (algorithmically selected)
2. Learn Mode for new concepts, Quiz Mode for review
3. Wrong answers trigger Reflection Mode
4. System updates your mastery model after each response
5. Done when queue is complete (or you choose to stop)

### Spaced Repetition
1. Each response updates mastery and stability
2. Algorithm calculates optimal next review time
3. Items enter your daily queue when due
4. Correctly remembered → interval grows; forgotten → interval shrinks

### AI Role
- **Generates** courses, content, and questions
- **Tutors** in Learn Mode (explains concepts)
- **Grades** free-form answers in Quiz Mode
- **Reflects** in Reflection Mode (helps understand mistakes)
- **Explores** in Curiosity Mode (answers any question)
