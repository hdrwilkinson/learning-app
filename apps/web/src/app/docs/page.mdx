## The One-Minute Version

**The Problem:**  
Traditional learning platforms focus on completion, not retention. You watch videos, finish courses, earn certificates—and forget most of it within weeks.

**The Solution:**  
Cognia breaks knowledge into atomic **Information Points**, tracks your mastery of each one, and uses evidence-based learning science—spaced repetition, retrieval practice, interleaving, and elaboration—to ensure you actually retain what you learn.

**The Result:**  
You don't just *complete* courses—you retain, understand, and can apply what you learned.

## Key Concepts at a Glance

| Concept | What It Is |
|---------|------------|
| **Information Point (IP)** | A single, testable concept—the atomic unit of knowledge |
| **Course** | A complete learning pathway, personalized for your goals |
| **Course Modes** | Learn (introduction), Quiz (testing), Reflect (mistakes)—tied to IPs |
| **Explore** | Free-form curiosity, like ChatGPT—separate from course structure |
| **Mastery** | A score (0-1) representing your recall ability for each IP |
| **Daily Queue** | The algorithm-selected items for today's study session |
