# Core Concepts

**The mental model you need to understand Cognia.**

---

Before diving into how things work, you need the vocabulary and concepts that everything else builds on. This section introduces the key ideas at a conceptual level—detailed specifications come later.

Think of this as the "glossary meets tutorial"—you'll understand what we mean when we use these terms throughout the rest of the documentation.

## The Big Picture

Cognia has four fundamental concepts:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                  │
│   1. THE LEARNING HIERARCHY                                      │
│      How content is organized                                    │
│      Course → Module → Lesson → Information Point                │
│                                                                  │
│   2. INFORMATION POINTS                                          │
│      The atomic unit of knowledge                                │
│      Everything else orbits around IPs                           │
│                                                                  │
│   3. THE FOUR LEARNING MODES                                     │
│      How you interact with content                               │
│      Learn, Quiz, Curiosity, Reflection                          │
│                                                                  │
│   4. MASTERY                                                     │
│      How we track what you know                                  │
│      Current vs. Baseline, states, scheduling                    │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each builds on the previous:
- The **hierarchy** organizes **Information Points**
- **Modes** are how you interact with Information Points
- **Mastery** tracks your relationship with each Information Point

| [The Learning Hierarchy](/docs/concepts/learning-hierarchy) | How content is structured from courses down to atomic concepts |
| [Information Points](/docs/concepts/information-points) | The atomic unit of learning—what they are and why they matter |
| [The Four Modes](/docs/concepts/learning-modes) | How you interact with content: Learn, Quiz, Curiosity, Reflection |
| [Understanding Mastery](/docs/concepts/mastery) | How the system tracks what you know and schedules review |

## Quick Reference

If you just need the terminology:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Course** | Complete learning pathway for a topic |
| **Module** | Major section of a course (e.g., "Fundamentals") |
| **Lesson** | Single study session's worth of content |
| **Information Point (IP)** | Single, testable concept—the atomic unit |
| **Learn Mode** | AI-guided introduction to new concepts |
| **Quiz Mode** | Active recall testing |
| **Curiosity Mode** | Free exploration and questioning |
| **Reflection Mode** | Understanding mistakes after wrong answers |
| **Mastery** | Score (0-1) representing your current recall ability |
| **Baseline** | Slowly-moving average representing stable understanding |
| **Stability** | How long before you'll likely forget (affects review timing) |
| **Daily Queue** | Algorithm-selected items for today's study session |
