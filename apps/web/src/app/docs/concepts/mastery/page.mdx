# Understanding Mastery

**How Cognia tracks what you know and schedules review.**

---

## The Core Problem

You learned something yesterday. Do you know it today?

This question has no simple answer. Memory isn't binary (known/unknown). It's probabilistic—the more time since review, the lower your probability of recall.

Cognia's mastery system models this reality.

---

## The Science Behind Mastery Tracking

Mastery tracking implements two key [learning science principles](/docs/concepts/learning-science):

| Principle | How Mastery Tracking Applies It |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Retrieval Practice** | Mastery only changes through active recall (quiz responses), not passive review |
| **Spaced Repetition** | The scheduling algorithm calculates optimal review intervals based on your performance |

> **Critical insight:** You cannot increase your mastery by re-reading. You can only increase it by successfully retrieving information from memory. This is why Quiz Mode is the core mechanic, not an optional test.

## Two Measures, Not One

For every Information Point, Cognia tracks two numbers:

### 1. Current Mastery (Volatile)
Your *right now* ability to recall this concept.

- Goes up when you answer correctly ← *Retrieval Practice: successful recall*
- Goes down when you answer wrong ← *Retrieval Practice: failed recall*
- Decays over time without review
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0

### 2. Baseline Mastery (Stable)
Your *underlying* understanding over time.

- Moves very slowly (exponential average)
- Represents proven, durable knowledge
- Buffers against temporary slips
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0

### Why Two?

Single-measure systems are fragile:

```
Single Measure Problem:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Day 1: Study, get 5 right      → Mastery: 0.85 ✓
Day 2: Bad day, get 2 wrong    → Mastery: 0.55 ✗
Day 3: Recover, get 3 right    → Mastery: 0.75
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
You "know" this, but one bad day tanks your score.
```

The dual-track system handles this:

```
Dual-Track System:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Day 1: Study, get 5 right      
  Current: 0.85  Baseline: 0.30 (still building)
  
Day 2: Bad day, get 2 wrong    
  Current: 0.55  Baseline: 0.35 (barely moved)
  
Day 3: Recover, get 3 right    
  Current: 0.80  Baseline: 0.40 (slowly climbing)
  
Day 10: Many correct answers
  Current: 0.90  Baseline: 0.75 (stable foundation)
  
Day 11: Temporary slip, 1 wrong
  Current: 0.75  Baseline: 0.74 (protected!)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Baseline protects proven knowledge from temporary slips.
```

## How Mastery Changes

> **Retrieval Practice in action:** Every mastery update comes from a quiz response—an act of active recall. There's no "I read it" button that increases mastery.

### On Correct Answer

```
boost = quizType.masteryBoost  // 0.05 to 0.15

// Recovery boost: if current is below baseline, recover faster
if (currentMastery < baselineMastery) {
  gap = baselineMastery - currentMastery
  recoveryBoost = gap * baselineConfidence * 0.5
  boost = boost + recoveryBoost
}

currentMastery = min(1.0, currentMastery + boost)
```

**What this means:**
- Harder quiz types give bigger boosts ← *Desirable Difficulty: harder retrieval = stronger memory*
- If you're below your baseline, you recover faster
- You can't go above 1.0

### On Wrong Answer

```
penalty = 0.15  // Fixed penalty regardless of quiz type

currentMastery = max(0.0, currentMastery - penalty)
```

**What this means:**
- Every wrong answer costs 0.15 (same penalty regardless of question difficulty)
- You can't go below 0.0

### Baseline Update (Every Response)

```
momentum = 0.95  // How slowly baseline moves

baselineMastery = (baselineMastery * 0.95) + (currentMastery * 0.05)
```

**What this means:**
- Baseline moves 5% toward current mastery after each response
- Takes many responses to significantly shift baseline
- Protects against both rapid drops AND artificial inflation

## Mastery States

IPs exist in one of four states based on current mastery:

```
┌────────┐    Learn Mode    ┌──────────┐    Quiz    ┌───────────┐
│ UNSEEN │ ───────────────▶ │ LEARNING │ ────────▶ │ REVIEWING │
└────────┘                  └──────────┘           └─────┬─────┘
                                 ▲                       │
                                 │                       │ ≥ 80% mastery
                                 │                       ▼
                                 │                 ┌──────────┐
                                 │                 │ MASTERED │
                                 │                 └────┬─────┘
                                 │                      │
                                 │     drops < 80%      │
                                 └──────────────────────┘
```

| State | Criteria | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Unseen** | Never introduced | Not quiz-eligible |
| **Learning** | Introduced, mastery > 0 | Begin quizzing ← *Retrieval Practice starts* |
| **Reviewing** | Mastery between 0 and 0.80 | Active reinforcement |
| **Mastered** | Mastery ≥ 0.80 | Maintenance mode ← *Spaced Repetition: longer intervals* |

**Lapse tracking:** If an IP drops from Mastered back to Reviewing, that's a "lapse." The system tracks lapses to identify fragile knowledge.

---

## Stability & Scheduling

> **Spaced Repetition in action:** Stability determines when you'll next see this concept. The goal is to review just before you'd forget—maximizing retention with minimum reviews.

Beyond mastery, the system tracks **stability**: how long until you'll likely forget.

```
Stability = estimated days until ~90% forgetting probability
```

### How Stability Changes

**On correct answer:**
```
stability = stability * quizType.stabilityMultiplier
```
- Binary (T/F): ×1.0 (no change)
- Multiple choice: ×1.5
- Q&A: ×2.0

Harder questions prove stronger memory → longer before next review.

**On wrong answer:**
```
stability = stability * 0.5
```
Memory is weaker than thought → schedule sooner.

### Next Review Calculation

```
baseInterval = stability

// Lower mastery = review sooner
masteryFactor = 0.5 + (currentMastery * 0.5)  // Range: 0.5 - 1.0
interval = baseInterval * masteryFactor

// Minimum intervals by state
if (state == 'learning')  interval = max(interval, 0)   // Same day OK
if (state == 'reviewing') interval = max(interval, 1)   // 1 day min
if (state == 'mastered')  interval = max(interval, 3)   // 3 days min

nextReviewAt = now + interval
```

## The Daily Queue

> **Interleaving in action:** The queue mixes items from different lessons rather than blocking by topic. This forces discrimination between concepts and improves transfer.

Each day, the system builds your study queue:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR DAILY QUEUE                                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                  │
│  Due for Review (70% of session)         ← Spaced Repetition    │
│  ─────────────────────────────────                              │
│  Items where nextReviewAt ≤ today                               │
│  Sorted by how overdue they are                                 │
│                                                                  │
│  New Items (30% of session)              ← Elaboration          │
│  ──────────────────────────                (new concepts)       │
│  Next IPs from your current lesson                              │
│  Capped to prevent overload                                     │
│                                                                  │
│  Interleaved                             ← Interleaving         │
│  ───────────                                                    │
│  Mixed together so you're not doing all reviews then all new    │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The algorithm decides:**
- What items to include ← *Spaced Repetition*
- What order to present them ← *Interleaving*
- What quiz types to use ← *Desirable Difficulty*
- When to introduce new material

**You decide:**
- Whether to show up
- How engaged to be

---

## Quiz Type Progression

> **Desirable Difficulty:** Harder question types feel more effortful but create stronger memories. As you prove understanding, the system challenges you with harder retrieval tasks.

As mastery increases, harder quiz types become available:

| Quiz Type | Unlocks At | Mastery Boost | Stability Mult |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Binary (T/F) | 0% | +0.05 | ×1.0 |
| Multiple Choice | 15% | +0.10 | ×1.5 |
| Question & Answer | 40% | +0.15 | ×2.0 |

**Strategy:**
- Early on: easy questions to build confidence
- As you progress: harder questions to prove deeper understanding
- Higher-difficulty questions accelerate toward mastery

## Key Takeaways

1. **Mastery comes from retrieval, not review** — you must actively recall to increase mastery
2. **Mastery is tracked per-IP** — granular precision, not vague progress
3. **Two tracks protect against volatility** — baseline buffers temporary slips
4. **The algorithm does the scheduling** — spaced repetition optimizes review timing
5. **Harder questions = faster progress** — desirable difficulty strengthens memory
6. **Honesty over encouragement** — real numbers, not inflated progress

The system is designed to be accurate, not flattering. That accuracy is what makes it effective.
