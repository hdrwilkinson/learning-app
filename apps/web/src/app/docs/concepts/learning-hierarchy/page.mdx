# The Learning Hierarchy

**How content is organized in Cognia.**

---

## The Four Levels

Every piece of content in Cognia exists within a hierarchical structure:

```
Course
├── Module 1 (foundation)
│   ├── Lesson 1.1
│   │   ├── Information Point 1
│   │   ├── Information Point 2
│   │   └── Information Point 3
│   ├── Lesson 1.2
│   │   └── ...
│   └── Lesson 1.3
│       └── ...
├── Module 2 (builds on Module 1)
│   ├── Lesson 2.1
│   └── ...
└── Module 3 (builds on Module 2)
    └── ...
```

Each level has a distinct purpose:

| Level | Purpose | Typical Size |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Course** | Complete learning journey for a topic | 1-16 weeks |
| **Module** | Major thematic section | 3-10 lessons |
| **Lesson** | Single study session | 3-7 Information Points |
| **Information Point** | One testable concept | ~5-10 minutes |

---

## Course

A **Course** is the top-level container—a complete learning pathway for a topic.

**Examples:**
- "Python for Data Science"
- "Introduction to Microeconomics"
- "Spanish for Travel"

A course contains:
- **Title and description**
- **Learning goal** (what you'll be able to do)
- **Your starting level** (determined by baseline quiz)
- **Study schedule** (days/week, minutes/day)
- **Modules** (the actual content)

**Key insight:** Courses are *generated for you*. The AI creates a course structure based on your topic, goals, and starting level. Two people learning "Python" might get different courses based on their backgrounds and objectives.

---

## Module

A **Module** is a major section of a course—a coherent unit of related concepts.

**Examples (within a Python course):**
- Module 1: "Python Fundamentals"
- Module 2: "Data Structures"
- Module 3: "Working with Files"
- Module 4: "Data Analysis with Pandas"

Modules have an **order** and **dependencies**:
- Module 2 builds on concepts from Module 1
- You can't truly understand Module 4 without Module 2 and 3

**In the UI:** Modules appear as collapsible sections on the course path. You can expand to see lessons or collapse to see a summary.

---

## Lesson

A **Lesson** is designed to fit in a single study session.

**Examples (within "Python Fundamentals"):**
- Lesson 1.1: "Variables and Types"
- Lesson 1.2: "Basic Operations"
- Lesson 1.3: "Control Flow"

Lessons are sized based on your schedule:
- 30-minute sessions → 4-5 IPs per lesson
- 60-minute sessions → 6-8 IPs per lesson

**Key insight:** Lessons are the primary unit you interact with. You click a lesson to enter it, study its Information Points, and move on.

---

## Information Point

An **Information Point (IP)** is the atomic unit—a single, testable concept.

**Examples (within "Variables and Types"):**
- "A variable is a named container for data"
- "Integer type in Python"
- "String type in Python"
- "Type conversion uses int(), str(), float()"
- "Variable naming rules"

This is where learning actually happens. [Learn more about Information Points →](/docs/concepts/information-points)

## Why This Structure?

The hierarchy serves specific purposes:

### 1. Pedagogical Sequencing
Knowledge builds on prior knowledge. The hierarchy makes dependencies explicit:
- IP 5 requires understanding IPs 1-4
- Lesson 2 assumes Lesson 1 content
- Module 3 builds on Modules 1 and 2

### 2. Flexible Scope
Not all topics need the same depth:
- A 2-week course might have 1-2 modules
- A 16-week course might have 8 modules
- The structure adapts to content size

### 3. Progress Tracking at Multiple Levels
You can see progress at any zoom level:
- "You've mastered 80% of this course"
- "This module is 60% complete"
- "3 more IPs in this lesson"

### 4. Manageable Sessions
Lessons are sized for single sessions, so you always have clear start and stop points.

## Navigation in the UI

The course path shows your progress visually:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Lesson states:**
- **Locked** (○): Previous lesson not completed
- **Available** (○): Ready to start
- **In Progress** (◐): Some IPs introduced
- **Learning** (●): All IPs introduced, actively quizzing
- **Mastered** (✓): All IPs at ≥80% mastery

---

## Skip-Ahead System

The hierarchy is sequential by default, but you can prove competency to skip ahead:

1. Click a locked lesson
2. Take a "skip quiz" covering prerequisite content
3. Score ≥80% to unlock

This respects the pedagogical sequence while not forcing you through content you already know.

---

## Scale Adaptation

The UI adapts based on course size:

| Course Size | Display |
|-------------|---------|
| 1 module, 1 lesson | Direct list of IPs (no module/lesson headers) |
| 1 module, multiple lessons | Lesson path only |
| Multiple modules | Full path with collapsible modules |

Small courses don't need unnecessary hierarchy chrome.
