# The Learning Science

**The four evidence-based principles that make Cognia work.**

---

Cognia isn't built on gamification tricks or engagement hacks. It's built on four principles from cognitive science that consistently show up in learning research. These aren't theoretical—they're the most robust findings we have about how human memory actually works.

## The Four Principles

│                                                                  │
│   4. ELABORATION                                                │

│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each principle is independently powerful. Together, they're the foundation of effective learning.

## 1. Spaced Repetition

> **Review at increasing intervals, not all at once.**

### The Science

In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered the "forgetting curve"—memory decays predictably over time. But he also found that reviewing at the right moment (just before you'd forget) strengthens memory more efficiently than massed practice.

**Key finding:** Spacing practice over time dramatically improves long-term retention compared to cramming the same amount of practice into one session.

### Where It Appears in Cognia

| Feature | How It Uses Spaced Repetition |
|---------|------------------------------|
| **Scheduling Algorithm** | Calculates optimal review intervals based on your performance |
| **Stability Tracking** | Estimates how long until you'll likely forget each concept |
| **Daily Queue** | Surfaces items when they're due, not before |
| **Growing Intervals** | Successful reviews → longer intervals; failures → shorter |

### What You Experience

You'll notice the system asks you about the same concept at increasing intervals: maybe tomorrow, then 3 days, then a week, then two weeks. This isn't repetition for its own sake—it's strategically timed to maximize retention with minimum review.

---

## 2. Retrieval Practice

> **Actively recall information, don't just re-read it.**

### The Science

The "testing effect" (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006) shows that actively retrieving information from memory strengthens learning far more than passive review. Re-reading feels productive but produces weak memories. Testing yourself—even without feedback—produces strong, durable memories.

**Key finding:** Students who tested themselves remembered 50-80% after a week. Students who re-read remembered only 10-20%.

### Where It Appears in Cognia

| Feature | How It Uses Retrieval Practice |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| **Quiz Mode** | The core mechanic—you retrieve, not review |
| **Completion Checks** | Learn Mode verifies understanding with mini-quizzes |
| **No "Mark as Read"** | You can't complete content without demonstrating recall |
| **Question Variety** | Different question types exercise different retrieval paths |

### What You Experience

Cognia doesn't let you passively consume. Every concept requires you to prove you can recall it. This feels harder than watching videos or re-reading notes—and that's the point. The effort of retrieval is what builds memory.

---

## 3. Interleaving

> **Mix related topics during practice instead of blocking one at a time.**

### The Science

Blocked practice (doing all problems of type A, then all of type B) feels easier but produces worse transfer to new situations. Interleaved practice (mixing A and B) forces you to discriminate between concepts and identify which approach applies—skills you need in the real world.

**Key finding:** Interleaving improves the ability to recognize which concept applies to a given problem, even though it feels harder during practice.

### Where It Appears in Cognia

| Feature | How It Uses Interleaving |
|---------|-------------------------|
| **Queue Building** | Mixes items from different lessons in your daily queue |
| **Cross-Lesson Review** | Concepts from Module 1 appear alongside Module 3 items |
| **Varied Question Types** | Same concept tested via T/F, then MC, then Q&A |
| **Round-Robin Selection** | Algorithm draws from multiple lessons, not one at a time |

### What You Experience

Your daily queue won't be "all Python variables, then all Python loops." It'll mix concepts so you have to think: "Wait, is this asking about variables or data types?" That moment of discrimination is where learning happens.

---

## 4. Elaboration

> **Connect new information to what you already know.**

### The Science

"Levels of processing" research (Craik & Lockhart, 1972) shows that deeper processing creates stronger memories. Asking "why?" and "how does this connect?" creates richer memory traces than shallow memorization. The "generation effect" shows that explaining in your own words beats passively receiving information.

**Key finding:** Information connected to existing knowledge is remembered better than isolated facts.

### Where It Appears in Cognia

| Feature | How It Uses Elaboration |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Learn Mode** | AI tutoring encourages questions, connections, examples |
| **Reflection Mode** | After wrong answers, explores *why* you were wrong |
| **Curiosity Mode** | Free exploration, asking "why," making connections |
| **Prerequisites** | Explicit links to prior concepts ("this builds on X") |
| **AI Explanations** | Adapts explanations to your level and prior knowledge |

### What You Experience

When you learn a new concept, the AI doesn't just define it—it connects it to what you've already learned, asks you to explain it, and helps you understand *why* it works. When you get something wrong, Reflection Mode doesn't just show the answer—it helps you understand your misconception.

## How They Work Together

A single study session in Cognia uses all four principles:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR STUDY SESSION                                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                  │
│  Queue item 1: Review "Variables" (Lesson 1)                    │
│  ├── SPACED REPETITION: Due today based on your stability       │
│  ├── RETRIEVAL PRACTICE: You answer a quiz question             │
│  └── INTERLEAVING: Next item is from a different lesson         │
│                                                                  │
│  Queue item 2: New concept "Functions" (Lesson 3)               │
│  ├── ELABORATION: AI connects functions to variables you know   │
│  ├── RETRIEVAL PRACTICE: Verification question before moving on │
│  └── INTERLEAVING: Mixed with review items, not isolated        │
│                                                                  │
│  Queue item 3: Review "Data Types" (Lesson 2)                   │
│  ├── SPACED REPETITION: Different interval than item 1          │
│  ├── RETRIEVAL PRACTICE: Different question type (Q&A)          │
│  └── You get it wrong → ELABORATION: Reflection Mode explains   │
│                                                                  │
│  ... and so on                                                   │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The principles reinforce each other:
- **Spaced repetition** decides *when* you practice
- **Retrieval practice** determines *how* you practice
- **Interleaving** shapes *what* you practice together
- **Elaboration** deepens *why* you understand

---

## What About Other Approaches?

### Dual Coding (Words + Visuals)
We use this where relevant (diagrams, code examples), but it's not a core mechanic.

### Desirable Difficulty
This is an umbrella concept—spacing, retrieval, and interleaving all create "desirable difficulties" that feel harder but produce better learning.

### Gamification
We deliberately don't use streaks, points, or leaderboards as primary motivators. The research on gamification is mixed, and it can undermine intrinsic motivation. We focus on what the learning science actually supports.

### Completion Metrics
"You've completed 80% of the course" is a vanity metric. "You can recall 80% of the concepts" is meaningful. We track the latter.

---

## Why This Matters

Most learning platforms optimize for:
- **Engagement** (time in app)
- **Completion** (courses finished)
- **Satisfaction** (feeling productive)

Cognia optimizes for:
- **Retention** (can you recall it later?)
- **Transfer** (can you apply it in new situations?)
- **Durability** (will you still know it in 6 months?)

The four principles aren't just theory—they're the most reliable path to these outcomes.
