# The Vision

**Why Cognia exists and what makes it different.**

---

Learning is broken. Not the act of learning itself—humans are remarkably good at acquiring knowledge when the conditions are right. What's broken is how we typically approach structured learning: courses that don't adapt, schedules that ignore how memory works, and no feedback on whether you actually *understand* something versus just *saw* it once.

Cognia is an attempt to fix this. It's a learning platform built on three insights:

1. **Knowledge has structure** — concepts build on other concepts in a specific order
2. **Memory is predictable** — we forget at consistent rates, and optimal review timing is calculable
3. **Learning science works** — four evidence-based principles (spaced repetition, retrieval practice, interleaving, elaboration) dramatically improve retention

This section explains the problem we're solving, how we solve it, and the principles that guide our design decisions.
