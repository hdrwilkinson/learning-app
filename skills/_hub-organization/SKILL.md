## Cross-Skill Workflows

### Starting Work on a Feature

When beginning a new feature, combine skills in this order:

1. **issue-management**: Create or find the issue to work on
2. **branching**: Create a feature branch with proper naming
3. _(do the work)_
4. **pushing-code**: Commit with conventional commits

### Completing a Feature

When finishing work, combine skills in this order:

1. **pushing-code**: Final commit and push
2. **code-review**: Self-review before requesting review
3. **issue-management**: Update issue with PR link

## Category Principles

1. **Traceability**: Every change links back to an issue
2. **Conventional naming**: Branches and commits follow consistent patterns
3. **Atomic changes**: Small, focused commits are easier to review
4. **Clear communication**: Commit messages and PR descriptions explain intent
