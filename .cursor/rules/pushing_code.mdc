# Pushing Code to Remote

Write a commit message adhering strictly to conventional commit standards:

- Use imperative mood (e.g., "add validation for login form").
- Clearly reference issue number: "(#ISSUE_NUMBER)".
- Briefly summarize the specific changes clearly and concisely.
- Update the issue description the commit is related to and add relevant comments to the thread

Example:

```
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git add X
git commit -m "feat(feature): title for commit (#issue-number)" -m "Additional information n_1" -m "Additional information n_2"
git push origin "branch"
```
Don't use MCP for git add ., commit and push, instead use your own cursor native tools.
