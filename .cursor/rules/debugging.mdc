## Debugging and Issue Resolution

- Always fully understand errors or bugs before attempting fixes.
- Clearly isolate each issue before addressing it; solve one problem at a time.
- Provide minimal, precise, and verifiable fixes.
- Verify that fixes address the root cause by rerunning tests or manual verification.
- Never introduce refactoring or unrelated changes in bug-fix commits.
