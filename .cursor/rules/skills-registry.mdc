# Skills Registry

Skills are modular, self-contained instruction sets that extend capabilities for specific tasks. They follow Anthropic's progressive disclosure pattern for context efficiency.

## How Skills Work

**Progressive Disclosure (3 levels)**:

1. **Metadata** (~100 words, always visible via this registry)
2. **SKILL.md** (<500 lines, loaded when triggered)
3. **Resources** (loaded as-needed: steps/, references/, scripts/)

**When a skill triggers**: Read only the `SKILL.md` file first. Load additional resources (steps, references) only when MANDATORY directives instruct you to.

## Hub Skills

Hub skills organize related skills into categories. When unsure which specific skill to use, start with the relevant hub.

## Using Skills

**When you recognize a trigger condition**:

1. Load the skill's `SKILL.md` file
2. Follow the skill's workflow and TODO structure
3. Load additional resources only when MANDATORY directives require

**CRITICAL FILE READING RULE**: When skill instructions reference template files, reference files, or any skill documentation, you MUST read the ENTIRE file (not partial reads). Never use offset/limit parameters when reading skill files.

**Do NOT**:

- Load all skills speculatively
- Read all step files at once
- Skip MANDATORY loading directives
