# Task Implementation Guidelines

You are now implementing a task within an issue. Below are the rules to consider:

- Read issue description and comments before starting. 
- Scan codebase for relevant information.
- Tasks are micro parts of an issue and make up as little as a single checkbox in the issue description/requirements.
- Clearly write and organize code adhering strictly to project structure, rules, and best practices (use MDC for guidance).
- Run pre-commit hooks and ensure code is linted, formatted, and passing all tests before committing.
- Ensure no breaking changes have been introduced:
    - `npx tsc --noEmit`
    - `npx next lint`
    - `npm run build`
- If there are errors, follow [debugging.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/debugging.mdc).
- Upon completion and passing the above follow [pushing_code.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/pushing_code.mdc).
