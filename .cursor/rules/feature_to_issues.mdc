# Feature to Issues

Ask questions to fully understand the feature for each issue. This Q&A can be iterative i.e. multiple rounds of question asking. Break down the feature into clear, independent issues. Each issue must include:

- Issue Title
    - Made up of a type from conventional commits
    - The feature that it's related to
    - A descriptive title
    -  e.g. `feat(auth): Implement OAuth Authentication (Google & GitHub)`
- Acceptance Criteria: clearly defined, specific conditions for completion.
- Identify edge cases and include them explicitly.
- Be as descriptive and detailed as possible.

Additional considerations:

- Assign it to `hdrwilkinson`
- Add labels

Once all issues have been created, add their titles. (with links to github) as an ordered list at the top of the feature page, under the title, e.g.

```
