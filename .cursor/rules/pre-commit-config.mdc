## Pre-Commit Steps

Firstly, look at all the files that have been created, edited or deleted. Ensure that they make sense architecturally in our system i.e. do they follow principle in [always.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/always.mdc). Next, review the code itself as a senior software engineer at google - ensure it's of the highest quality.

Once the code structure is correct, run these pre-commit commands locally. Fix any issues that arise [debugging.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/debugging.mdc)., and then re-run until all pass.

1. Run `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e` to check all tests pass. 
2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx next lint`, and `npm run build`.
