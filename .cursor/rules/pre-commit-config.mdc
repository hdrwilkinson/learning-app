## Pre-Commit Steps

Run these pre-commit commands locally. Fix any issues that arise [debugging.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/debugging.mdc)., and then re-run until all pass.

1. Run `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e` to check all tests pass. 
2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx next lint`, and `npm run build`.
