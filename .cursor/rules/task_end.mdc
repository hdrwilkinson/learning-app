# Task Completion Guidelines

1. Run `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e` to check all tests pass. 
2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx next lint`, and `npm run build`. Fix any issues [debugging.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/debugging.mdc).
3. Git: add relevant files, commit and push to branch. Use tools to find branch and MDC for commit message template.
4. Issue: 
    - Read the issue, add a comment. 
    - Then, update the issue description.
